Great question — and you're thinking exactly like a product manager should.

The version I gave is **good for an initial developer request**, but if you want to make it **“Replit-perfect”** — meaning highly executable with minimal back-and-forth — we can definitely tighten and expand it. Replit devs will appreciate **explicit data models, field types, and UI expectations**.

Here’s a **fully upgraded version** you can paste into Replit with everything clearly spelled out:

---

### 🛠️ **Feature Request: Full Course Page Management in Admin Dashboard**

#### 👋 What I Have

In the current admin dashboard under **`/admin/courses`**, I can create and edit basic course data:

* `title` (string)
* `slug` (string)
* `description` (text)
* `level` (enum or string)
* `duration` (string or number)
* `price` (number)
* `category` (enum or string)
* `icon` (image upload)

These are used to populate the **course card** on the public `/courses` listing.

#### ✅ What I Want (Full Admin Editing of Course Detail Page)

Please expand the admin dashboard so I can fully manage the **course detail page** as well. Here's what needs to be added:

---

### 1. 📝 **Overview Section**

* Field: `overview` (rich text editor or textarea)
* Stored as HTML or Markdown
* Displayed at top of course detail page

---

### 2. 📚 **Curriculum Section**

* Structure:

```json
"curriculum": [
  {
    "sectionTitle": "Introduction to X",
    "items": [
      "Lesson 1: Basics",
      "Lesson 2: Advanced topics"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

* Admin UI should allow:

  * Add/remove/edit sections
  * Add/remove/edit items within a section

---

### 3. ⏰ **Batches Section**

* Structure:

```json
"batches": [
  {
    "startDate": "2025-06-15",
    "time": "10:00 AM - 12:00 PM",
    "mode": "online",
    "instructor": "John Doe"
  },
  ...
]
```

* Admin should be able to:

  * Add/remove/edit batches
  * Choose “mode” from dropdown (online/offline)
  * Instructor field can be free text or dropdown (if instructors are in DB)

---

### 4. 💰 **Fees Section**

* Allow multiple fee structures (optional)

```json
"fees": [
  {
    "label": "Standard Plan",
    "amount": 1999,
    "notes": "Includes certificate"
  },
  ...
]
```

* Otherwise, a single `feeDescription` field is fine if simpler.

---

### 5. 📸 **Media Uploads**

* Add support for:

  * `mainImage` (image upload, shown on course detail)
  * `logo` (image upload, shown on course card or detail header)
* Accept JPG/PNG, ideally under 1MB

---

### ✅ Admin Interface Expectations

* These new sections should appear when editing a course (`/admin/courses/:id`)
* Form fields should be pre-populated with existing data for editing
* Save button should commit all fields (current + new) to the backend

---

### 📦 Suggested Schema (optional for dev)

```json
{
  "title": "Course Title",
  "slug": "course-title",
  "description": "...",
  "level": "Beginner",
  "duration": "4 weeks",
  "price": 2999,
  "category": "Design",
  "icon": "icon-url",
  "mainImage": "image-url",
  "logo": "logo-url",
  "overview": "<p>Rich text HTML</p>",
  "curriculum": [...],
  "batches": [...],
  "fees": [...]
}
```

### 📎 Attachments

I've attached screenshots of:

* Current admin layout
* Public course page with the desired sections

Let me know if you need:

* Wireframes
* DB schema migrations
* Field validation rules

Thanks!

### ✅ Ready to Paste into Replit

You can paste this directly into a Replit chat, comment, or planning doc, and a developer should be able to act on it without needing follow-up clarification.

Let me know if you’d like me to turn this into a **GitHub issue template**, **Trello card**, or **Notion spec**.
